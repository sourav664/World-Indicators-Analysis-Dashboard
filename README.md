## 📊 Key KPI Cards

The dashboard includes the following indicators:

- 💰 Average GDP per Capita  
- 🌐 Average Trade Value  
- 📈 Current GDP  
- 🚀 Average GDP Growth (%)  
- 🌳 Forest Area (% of Land Area)  
- ⚖ Average Gini Index  
- 📚 Literacy Rate  
- 💹 Inflation Rate  

These KPIs provide a high-level summary of global performance across countries and regions.

## 📉 Poverty Reduction Analysis

### 🌟 Countries with Strong Poverty Reduction (> 80%)

- Azerbaijan  
- Belarus  
- Vietnam  
- Thailand  

These countries reduced poverty by more than 80%, indicating strong economic reforms, trade expansion, and social development improvements.

---

### ⚠ Countries with Negative Poverty Reduction

- Montenegro → -78.57%  
- Belize → -52.49%  
- Uruguay → -49.14%  
- Serbia → -40.71%  

Negative poverty reduction values indicate that poverty levels increased during the observed period. Possible reasons include economic slowdown, inflationary pressure, or structural challenges.

## 🏥 Health Expenditure vs Life Expectancy

The analysis shows a **positive coefficient** between:

- Current Health Expenditure (% of GDP)  
- Life Expectancy  

### 📈 Interpretation

A positive coefficient means that as healthcare spending increases, life expectancy also increases.

This suggests that higher investment in healthcare contributes to:

- Better medical infrastructure  
- Improved healthcare access  
- Lower mortality rates  
- Longer average lifespan

## 🌳 Forest Area Trend Analysis (2000–2024)

### 📉 Key Finding

- Forest Area in 2000: 32.83%  
- Forest Area in 2024: 31.71%  

**Total decline:** 1.12 percentage points

### 📊 Interpretation

Although the percentage decline appears small, it represents a consistent downward trend over 24 years. This may be linked to:

- Urbanization  
- Agricultural land conversion  
- Industrial development  
- Deforestation  

This trend highlights long-term environmental sustainability concerns.

## 🔎 Overall Key Insights

- Strong economic reforms significantly reduce poverty.
- Income inequality varies widely across countries.
- Healthcare investment positively influences life expectancy.
- Economic expansion may impact environmental sustainability.
- Forest coverage has gradually declined over time.
